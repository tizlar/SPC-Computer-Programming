A Collection is a data structure in which Objects are stored.
Objects can be Added, Deleted and traversed in a Collection.
There are 4 basic types of Collection
List : Ordered, Duplicates are allowed, Indexed
Sets : May or may not be ordered. Duplicates are not allowed.
Maps : Duplicate keys are not allowed.
Queue : Ordered by FIFO or priority.
ArrayList : Fast Iteration & Fast Random Access.
Vector: Similar to ArrayList but synchronized.
LinkedList : Good for implementing Stack and Queue.
HashSet : Fast Access, No Duplicates, No Ordering.
LinkedHashSet : No Duplicates, Iterates by insertion order.
TreeSet : No Duplicates, Iterates in sorted order.
