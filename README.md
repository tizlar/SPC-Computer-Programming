# SPC-Computer-Programming
This is a repository to upload the course work I completed while obtaining my A.S in Computer Programming &amp; Analytics

While much of the work in this repository is not perfect, it was one of the first steps in my programming journey. 
The work here is not indicitive of my current programming skill sets - I have continued to develop my skills in a professional environment. 
This repository should only serve as an reference as to where I started.
